It is wonderful to be here with you. My name is Steve Wang, I live in Shanghai, China. You know, [Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) the founder of [Apple Inc](https://www.apple.com/) is creative and aspirational, he had great and enduring contributions to the world, my English name comes from him.

I am a programmer, which is just a job for making a living sometimes. But I still want to dedicate something to the world, so I created the blog. 

God bless you.
